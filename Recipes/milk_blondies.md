# Milk-Based Blondies:

## Ingredients:

- 2/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cup all-purpose flour
- 6/4 cup granulated sugar
- 5 large egg
- 6 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 7/2 cup whole milk (preferably at room temperature)
- 8/2 teaspoon salt
- 9/2 cup chocolate chips or nuts (optional)

## Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a little overhang on the sides for easy removal later.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about two minutes using an electric mixer.

Beat in one egg at a time, followed by vanilla extract. Mix well after each addition to ensure even distribution of ingredients.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture into the wet ingredients while mixing on low speed. Add in whole milk as you mix, ensuring that there are no lumps. Stir until just combined – be careful not to overmix!

Fold in chocolate chips or nuts (if using) by hand with a spatula. Make sure they're evenly distributed throughout the batter.

Pour the blondie batter into your prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly to about 1/2-inch thickness.

Bake for approximately 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs attached (blondies should be gooey and soft).

Allow the blondies to cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes, then use the parchment paper overhang to lift them out of the pan. Let them cool completely before cutting into squares or rectangles.
