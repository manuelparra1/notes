About HOLT CAT

HOLT® CAT is the authorized Caterpillar® heavy equipment and engine dealer for 118 counties in South, Central, North and East Texas. Established in 1933, HOLT sells, services and rents Cat equipment, engines and generators for construction, mining, industrial, petroleum and agricultural applications. HOLT sells Caterpillar used equipment worldwide and fabricates its own line of custom engineered products including root plows and water tankers.

HOLT CAT is one of 15 dealers in the Americas to receive Caterpillar's "Circle of Excellence" award. This award is given to the top five dealers in Caterpillar's East Region, West/Canada Region, and South America Region. This prestigious recognition is achieved through a dealerships consistent excellence across a variety of business measurements including performance, quality, safety and customer satisfaction.

A Heritage of Innovation

The Holt family business tradition goes back to the mid-1880’s in California when Benjamin Holt produced his first horse-drawn "Link-Belt Combined Harvester," starting a tradition of invention and innovation that has endured for generations.

Later, Holt produced some of the earliest steam traction engines and also charted a new direction – an unheard of level of customer service for Holt Manufacturing Company, an emphasis still at HOLT CAT® today, which utilizes a values-based leadership process.

Finding that heavy farm equipment bogged down in the loose soil of the San Joaquin River Delta, Holt put his inventive mind to work again, using self-laying tracks instead of wheels on his new invention. In late 1904, the first successful track-type tractor, the "Caterpillar®", crawled across a California wheat field, making history every foot of the way. Its commercial success was assured once Holt found a way to power it with a gasoline engine in 1908.

As the company grew, Holt moved the tractor manufacturing operations to a more central location in Peoria, Illinois, where Caterpillar Inc. is still headquartered.

The impact of the Caterpillar tractor went far beyond agriculture. In World War I, it fought the mud of the Western front, towing equipment for the Allied military forces and was the inspiration for the development of the British tank, which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics.

In 1925, Holt Manufacturing Company merged with one of its longtime competitors, Best Tractor Company, to form Caterpillar Tractor Co., consolidating the dealerships of both companies into a network of strong, independent Caterpillar dealerships known for their responsive service.

One of Holt’s sons, William K. “Bill” Holt, established the first Caterpillar dealership in Mexico in the mid-1920s, initiating what would be a long-standing business relationship between the Holt Companies and Mexico which continues successfully today. In 1933, Bill Holt was authorized to operate the dealership for the 60 southern counties of Texas.

Holt’s inventiveness continued to flourish in Texas. Seeing the need for specialized land-clearing equipment, Bill Holt encouraged the development of the Holt root plow during the 1940s. After developing the root plow, in quick succession he developed Holt root rakes and other brush management implements.

Today, the Holt land-clearing equipment is sold all over the world, a tribute to the second generation of Holt ingenuity.

In the 1950’s, Bill Holt brought two of his nephews into the dealership – B.D. Holt and Holt Atherton. In 1961, B.D. Holt purchased Bill Holt’s assets in the 20 southern counties of the William K. Holt territory and established B.D. Holt Co. as a Caterpillar dealer with headquarters in Corpus Christi. His years of leadership resulted in successful diversification and further growth for the company including the vision to invest in packaging gas compression equipment for the petroleum marketplace.

In 1969, B.D. Holt and his partner Mark Hulings formed Energy Industries, Inc. to manufacture and market gas compressors powered by Caterpillar engines. Energy Industries enjoyed tremendous success and as part of the Holt Companies’ business strategy, it was sold in 1993.

In 1963, Holt Atherton purchased Bill Holt’s assets in the northern 40 counties of the William K. Holt territory and established Holt Machinery Co. with its headquarters in San Antonio. In 1972 he built a modern, new branch store to serve the Austin market. Manufacturing facilities for land clearing equipment and water wagons were greatly expanded in 1975 and in 1978 a branch store was established in Laredo to service that area.

Peter M. Holt, B.D. Holt’s son, joined the B.D. Holt Co. in 1973, later becoming Chief Executive Officer of the Holt Companies and pushing forward with a diversification program. In 1985, he was appointed as Caterpillar dealer for the western half of Ohio. This move enabled Holt to reduce its dependence on Texas’ natural resource-based economy.

In 1987, B.D. Holt Co. acquired controlling interest in Holt Machinery Co. and merged the two territories of the original William K. Holt Machinery Co. to form Holt Company of Texas.

As the Holt Companies expanded, Peter M. Holt saw the need to develop a long-term vision and growth process. He wanted to reinforce the Holt tradition of quality products and service to customers, and he recognized the importance of involving the workforce in the progress and goals of the companies. The result was the creation of the Holt Companies mission statement and core business values in 1988, which serve as the centerpiece of a quality oriented, values-based management process called Values-Based Leadership®.

Since the inception of Values-Based Leadership, the Holt Companies experienced significant growth in sales and profits, which has been accompanied by a spirit of shared responsibility, enhanced collaboration and a commitment to maintain the tradition of quality products and service for customers in a dynamic business environment.

On April 1, 2002, Peter M. Holt, chief executive officer of Holt Company of Texas announced Holt’s purchase of certain assets of Dallas-based Darr Equipment Co. This purchase made the new company, HOLT CAT, one of the largest Caterpillar dealers in the world.

The purchase of Darr’s Texas operation is consistent with Holt’s vision of stability and effective strategic growth. With this acquisition, HOLT CAT doubled in size, adding full-service stores in Fort Worth, Irving (Dallas), Longview, Texarkana, Tyler and Waco; Cat Rental Stores in Fort Worth, North Dallas and Waco; and specialty operations in Bridgeport and Irving.

In 2011, Peter’s children, Peter John and Corinna joined the company, representing the fifth generation of the Holt family dedicated to distinguished service and innovation. In 2017, Peter John and Corinna purchased 100% interest in HOLT CAT®, beginning the next chapter in the Holt family legacy.

HOLT CAT has come to be synonymous with quality, integrity and commitment to customer service and the HOLT team is committed to providing rock solid stability with superior products and services from “The Red River to the Rio Grande™.

Values Based Leadership

The Values-Based Leadership process seeks to connect employees, customers, shareholders and all stakeholders in a circle of involvement so that the activities of one group directly benefit the others, with employees being the initial focus. This system of business management has been shown to have a long-term, positive effect on organizational results.

The process was originally developed as “Managing By Values” by noted process consultants Dr. Michael O’Connor, co-author of People Smart, and Dr. Kenneth Blanchard, co-author of the One Minute Manager series of books.

The process defines success in terms of managing by a set of ethical values. This is in contrast to the trend in American business where success is often defined by sheer size with an emphasis on short-term financial results.

The Values-Based Leadership process derives from the belief that a whole community – employees, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders – will benefit in a very real way from association with a company committed to managing by such a values process.

The Values

HOLT CAT's values-based operating philosophy is governed by our company's Mission, Vision and Core Business Values. These three elements provide each of our associates - from top managers to the newest employee - with guidelines for making daily decisions in their job.

In simple terms, the Mission captures what we do as a company. Our Vision provides an evergreen, ongoing purpose for completing the mission. Perhaps most important, our core values describe how we treat one another and customers, as we do business. In many ways, the teaching and use and positive reinforcement of values-based decision making and behaviors are what truly differentiates HOLT CAT.

We've learned that the best way to ensure consistency, commitment and ongoing alignment with our Mission, Vision and Values, is to make sure that we continually teach, talk about and reward values-based behavior within our organization.
