## Prompt

### Me

##### Can you explain this line in my .zshrc?

```shell
if [[ -z "${OPENAI_API_KEY}" ]]; then
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(pass openai/api_key)
fi
```

### GROQ

##### Certainly! This is a conditional statement written in the Z shell configuration file (`.zshrc`). It checks if the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is empty or not set (`-z` flag). If it is empty, the script will execute the command on the right side of the `export` statement.

##### The command `pass openai/api_key` is using the `pass` command-line tool to retrieve the password for the `openai/api_key` entry stored in the password manager. The retrieved value is then assigned to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable using the `export` command.

##### In summary, this line of code checks if the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set, and if not, it sets it to the value retrieved from the `pass` password manager for the `openai/api_key` entry. This is useful for storing and retrieving sensitive information like API keys securely.

## Prompt

### Me

##### I use this in my zshrc to set a variable with a secret api key for safety. I use it for my terminal to run cli utilities that use api keys so it makes sense to have them in variables. I use the same terminal to open nvim and inside it I launch an internal terminal. The I don't want starship to change my prompt format when inside a shell inside nvim. Could I change that line to only execute if my TERM variable include "kitty" in the name (kitty is my terminal emulator)

```shell
if [[ -z "${OPENAI_API_KEY}" ]]; then
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(pass openai/api_key)
fi

export OPENAI_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(pass anthropic/api_key)
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=$(pass voyage/api_key)

# Starship
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

### GROQ

##### Yes, you can modify the line to only execute the command if your terminal emulator is `kitty`. You can use an `if` statement to check if the `TERM` variable contains the string `kitty`. Here's an example:

```bash
if [[ $TERM == *kitty* && -z "${OPENAI_API_KEY}" ]]; then
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(pass openai/api_key)
fi

export OPENAI_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(pass anthropic/api_key)
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=$(pass voyage/api_key)

# Starship
if [[ $TERM == *kitty* ]]; then
  eval "$(starship init zsh --print-full-command)"
fi
```

##### This code checks if the `TERM` variable contains the string `kitty` and if the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set. If both conditions are true, it sets the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to the value retrieved from the `pass` password manager for the `openai/api_key` entry.

##### Additionally, it checks if the `TERM` variable contains the string `kitty` before initializing Starship prompt. If it does, it initializes Starship prompt using the `--print-full-command` option to avoid changing the prompt format when inside a shell inside Neovim.

##### Note that the `--print-full-command` option is available in Starship version 1.8.0 or later. If you are using an older version of Starship, you may need to update it or remove the option.
