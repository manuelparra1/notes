I'm running into issues using ls because themes are in /usr/share/pandoc/data/templates/\*.tex. this will make output file name large How do i trim the parent directories? the pandoc command know where the theme is and only requires the name and extension of the template

I see. In that case, you can modify the script to use the find command to search for the templates in the /usr/share/pandoc/data/templates directory. Here's the updated script:

#!/bin/bash

input_file="Guide.md"

find /usr/share/pandoc/data/templates -type f -name "\*.tex" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' template; do
template*name="$(basename -- "$template")"
template_name="${template_name%.tex}"
  pandoc --pdf-engine=xelatex -f markdown -t pdf --template="$template" "$input_file" -o "Guide*$template_name.pdf"
done

This script does the following:

    Sets the input file to "Guide.md".
    Uses find to search for .tex files in the /usr/share/pandoc/data/templates directory.
    Iterates through the templates using a while loop.
    For each template, extracts the template name without the .tex extension using basename and parameter expansion.
    Runs the pandoc command using the current template and input file, and outputs the result to a file named "Guide_<Template Name>.pdf".

Save this script as a file (e.g., "convert_guide.sh") and run it using:

bash convert_guide.sh

This will convert the "Guide.md" file using each template and output the result to a file named "Guide*<Template Name>.pdf".
Can you help me write a for loop that converts a markdown file named Guide.md to Guide*`template_name`.pdf ls -1 \*.tex barfi.tex chocolate-box.tex cobalt.tex drake-ayu.tex drake-black.tex drake-dark.tex drake-google.tex drake-juejin.tex drake-light.tex drake-material.tex drake-purple.tex drake.tex drake-vue.tex evangelion.tex gitbook-azure.tex gitbook-slate.tex gitbook-teal.tex gothic.tex law.tex mint-dark.tex mint.tex mo-dark.tex mo.tex newsprint.tex notes-dark.tex notion-dark-classic.tex notion-dark-enhanced.tex notion-darker-classic.tex notion-darker-enhanced.tex notion-light-classic.tex notion-light-enhanced.tex onedark.tex orangeheart.tex panda.tex paradox-phantom.tex paradox-seraph.tex pie-dark.tex pie.tex purple-blue.tex purple-cesno.tex purple-classic.tex purple-green.tex purple-plain.tex purple.tex rubrication.tex scrolls-dark.tex scrolls.tex solarized-dark.tex solarized.tex turing.tex ursine-polar.tex ursine-umbra.tex xydark.tex xylight.tex I want to use each template name without the .tex extension in this command to name the output file and also the template file name for referencing in argument. pandoc --pdf-engine=xelatex -f markdown -t pdf --template=newsprint.tex Guide.md > Guide\_<Template Name>.pdf

Sure! You can use a for loop in combination with parameter expansion to achieve this. Here's a bash script that does what you want:

#!/bin/bash

input_file="Guide.md"
templates=($(ls \*.tex))

for template in "${templates[@]}"; do
  template_name="${template%.tex}"
pandoc --pdf-engine=xelatex -f markdown -t pdf --template="$template" "$input*file" -o "Guide*$template_name.pdf"
done

This script does the following:

    Sets the input file to "Guide.md".
    Lists all .tex files in the current directory and stores them in the templates array.
    Iterates through the templates array using a for loop.
    For each template, extracts the template name without the .tex extension using parameter expansion.
    Runs the pandoc command using the current template and input file, and outputs the result to a file named "Guide_<Template Name>.pdf".

Save this script as a file (e.g., "convert_guide.sh") and run it using:

bash convert_guide.sh

This will convert the "Guide.md" file using each template and output the result to a file named "Guide\_<Template Name>.pdf".
Is it possible to use a theme for the text formatting and fonts and sizes?

Yes, you can use a LaTeX template or a CSS file to style your document.

For PDF output, you can use a LaTeX template or a package like koma-script to customize the appearance of your document. Here's an example using the scrreprt class from koma-script:

    Create a new file called "preamble.tex" and add the following content:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{scrreprt}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{
top=30mm,
bottom=30mm,
left=20mm,
right=20mm,
}
\usepackage{blindtext} % For generating random text

This file sets up the scrreprt class, configures the font encoding, includes the lmodern package for a modern font, and sets up the page geometry.

    Convert "Guide.md" to PDF using the "preamble.tex" file:

pandoc Guide.md -H preamble.tex -s -o Guide.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into a PDF file (-o Guide.pdf) using XeLaTeX (--pdf-engine=xelatex), including the "preamble.tex" file (-H preamble.tex) for customization.

For HTML output, you can use a CSS file to style your document. Here's an example:

    Create a new file called "style.css" and add the following content:

body {
font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
line-height: 1.5;
color: #333;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
font-weight: normal;
line-height: 1.2;
}

h1 {
font-size: 2.5em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h2 {
font-size: 2em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h3 {
font-size: 1.5em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h4 {
font-size: 1.2em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h5 {
font-size: 1em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h6 {
font-size: 0.8em;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

p {
margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

a {
color: #007bff;
text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
text-decoration: underline;
}

This file sets up the font, font sizes, and styles for the HTML document.

    Convert "Guide.md" to HTML using the "style.css" file:

pandoc Guide.md -c style.css -s -o Guide.html

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into an HTML file (-o Guide.html) and includes the "style.css" file (-c style.css) for customization.

After running these commands, you should see the "Guide.pdf" or "Guide.html" files with the styled contents.
Is it a suggested dependency, because I installed texlive with apt and saw a list of suggested packages, but didn't know how to install them

I apologize for the confusion. Installing TeX Live with your package manager should include XeLaTeX, but it might not always install all the required dependencies for certain features.

To install the suggested dependencies for pandoc on Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), you can use the following command:

sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-luatex texlive-latex-recommended texlive-xetex texlive-generic-recommended

This command installs the recommended TeX Live packages for XeLaTeX and LaTeX.

After installing these packages, you should be able to run the pandoc command to convert "Guide.md" to PDF using XeLaTeX:

pandoc Guide.md -s -o Guide.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into a PDF file (-o Guide.pdf) using XeLaTeX (--pdf-engine=xelatex) and setting the geometry options (-V geometry:margin=1in) for 1-inch margins.

After running this command, you should see the "Guide.pdf" file with the converted contents.
pandoc Guide.md -s -o Guide.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in xelatex not found. Please select a different --pdf-engine or install xelatex -- see also /usr/share/doc/pandoc/README.Debian

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that XeLaTeX is not installed on your system. You can install TeX Live, which includes XeLaTeX, using your package manager.

For Ubuntu, you can install TeX Live with:

sudo apt-get install texlive

For Fedora, you can install TeX Live with:

sudo dnf install texlive

After installing TeX Live, you should be able to run the pandoc command to convert "Guide.md" to PDF using XeLaTeX:

pandoc Guide.md -s -o Guide.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into a PDF file (-o Guide.pdf) using XeLaTeX (--pdf-engine=xelatex) and setting the geometry options (-V geometry:margin=1in) for 1-inch margins.

After running this command, you should see the "Guide.pdf" file with the converted contents.
Can you show me how to use pandoc to convert this new file Guide.md into HTML and PDF?

Sure! First, make sure you have pandoc installed on your system. If you don't have it, install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

sudo apt-get install pandoc

Once you have pandoc installed, you can convert the "Guide.md" file into HTML and PDF using the following commands:

    Convert "Guide.md" to HTML:

pandoc Guide.md -s -o Guide.html

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into an HTML file (-o Guide.html).

    Convert "Guide.md" to PDF:

To convert "Guide.md" to PDF, you need a LaTeX engine installed on your system, such as TeX Live. If you don't have it, install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

sudo apt-get install texlive

After installing TeX Live, you can convert "Guide.md" to PDF using the following command:

pandoc Guide.md -s -o Guide.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in

This command uses pandoc to convert (-s) the "Guide.md" file into a PDF file (-o Guide.pdf) using XeLaTeX (--pdf-engine=xelatex) and setting the geometry options (-V geometry:margin=1in) for 1-inch margins.

After running these commands, you should see the "Guide.html" and "Guide.pdf" files with the converted contents.
Once I have this directory with these files: ls -1 Test_1.md Test_2.md Test_3.md Test_4.md Test_5.md Test_6.md How can I combine the contents into one file called Guide.md?

You can use the cat command to combine the contents of the files into one file called "Guide.md". Here's how you can do it:

    Create the "Guide.md" file if it doesn't exist:

touch Guide.md

    Use the cat command to combine the contents of the files into "Guide.md":

cat Test\_\*.md > Guide.md

This command uses cat to concatenate (>) the contents of the files matching the pattern "Test\_\*.md" into the "Guide.md" file.

After running this command, you should see the combined contents in the "Guide.md" file.
what does --parents do? I just want to copy over the markdown file itself to the Udemy-Guide directory

I apologize for the confusion. The --parents option preserves the directory structure when copying the files. Since you want to copy only the markdown files without preserving the directory structure, you can omit the --parents option.

Here's the updated command:

fd -g "Test\*.md" | xargs -I % cp % Udemy-Guide/

This command uses fd to find the files matching the pattern "Test\*.md" and outputs the relative paths. The output is then piped (|) to xargs, which reads the input and executes the cp command for each file, copying them (cp % Udemy-Guide/) to the "Udemy-Guide" directory without preserving the directory structure.

The -I % option tells xargs to replace % with the input line.
What about using fd -g "Test\*.md" which returns each file with relative path? Will xargs handle each item?

Yes, you can use fd -g "Test\*.md" to find the files and then pipe the results to xargs to copy them. Here's how you can do it:

    Create the "Udemy-Guide" directory if it doesn't exist:

mkdir -p Udemy-Guide

    Use fd to find the files and pipe the results to xargs to copy them:

fd -g "Test\*.md" | xargs -I % cp --parents % Udemy-Guide/

This command uses fd to find the files matching the pattern "Test\*.md" and outputs the relative paths. The output is then piped (|) to xargs, which reads the input and executes the cp command for each file, copying them (cp --parents % Udemy-Guide/) to the "Udemy-Guide" directory while preserving the directory structure.

The -I % option tells xargs to replace % with the input line.

This method demonstrates another alternative way to achieve the same goal using fd and xargs.
What about using the fd utility. I'm still learning how to use it. I do like using find and know about the -exec function.

Sure! You can use the fd utility to find the files and then pipe the results to xargs to copy them. Here's how you can do it:

    Create the "Udemy-Guide" directory if it doesn't exist:

mkdir -p Udemy-Guide

    Use fd to find the files and pipe the results to xargs to copy them:

fd -H -d 1 -e md Test-_ Test\__.md | xargs -I % cp % Udemy-Guide/

This command uses fd to find the files with headers (-H) and a depth of 1 (-d 1) that match the pattern "Test-" and "Test\_.md". The output is then piped (|) to xargs, which reads the input and executes the cp command for each file, copying them (cp % Udemy-Guide/) to the "Udemy-Guide" directory.

The -I % option tells xargs to replace % with the input line.

This method demonstrates an alternative way to achieve the same goal using fd and xargs.
Is this the only way to achieve this in the command line?

While the method I provided is a common and straightforward way to achieve this, there are alternative approaches. Here's another method using a for loop:

    Create the "Udemy-Guide" directory if it doesn't exist:

mkdir -p Udemy-Guide

    Use a for loop to iterate through the files matching the pattern and copy them to the "Udemy-Guide" directory:

for file in Test-_/Test\__.md; do
cp "$file" Udemy-Guide/
done

This method uses a for loop to iterate through the files matching the pattern "Test-/Test\_.md" and copies them (cp "$file" Udemy-Guide/) to the "Udemy-Guide" directory.

Both methods achieve the same goal, and you can choose the one that you find more readable or suitable for your use case.
I have a directory with subdirectories named Test-1, Test-2... fd -g "Test\*.md" Test-1/Test_1.md Test-2/Test_2.md Test-3/Test_3.md Test-4/Test_4.md Test-5/Test_5.md Test-6/Test_6.md I want to copy all the files matching my pattern to a new directory named Udemy-Guide/

You can achieve this using the cp (copy) command in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

First, create the new directory "Udemy-Guide" using the mkdir command:

mkdir Udemy-Guide

Next, use the find command to locate the files matching the pattern "Test\*.md" and copy them to the "Udemy-Guide" directory using the cp command:

find . -type f -name "Test\*.md" -exec cp {} Udemy-Guide/ \;

This command uses find to locate files (-type f) with names matching the pattern "Test\*.md" and copies them (-exec cp {} Udemy-Guide/) to the "Udemy-Guide" directory. The {} placeholder is replaced with the current file name, and the \; indicates the end of the -exec command.

After running this command, you should see the files in the "Udemy-Guide" directory.
