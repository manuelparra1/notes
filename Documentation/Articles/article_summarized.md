A recent study conducted on Generation Z individuals in the US revealed that 36% of respondents feel guilty about using AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the workplace. While many see the benefits of AI in aiding with tasks such as researching, generating ideas, and writing content, some express concerns about dependency and limitations on critical thinking and creativity. The study also highlighted the need for better education and training on the proper use of AI in the workplace. Despite concerns about AI potentially replacing jobs, Gen Z individuals are optimistic about its impact on creativity and earnings. As AI continues to evolve, finding a balance between leveraging its advantages and avoiding over-reliance will be crucial in shaping the future of work.
