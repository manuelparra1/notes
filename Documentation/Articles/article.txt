In recent years, there has been growing concern about artificial intelligence's impact on the future of work. While some argue that AI will lead to job losses and increased inequality, others believe it can enhance productivity and create new opportunities. Gen Z individuals, born after 1996, are better positioned than anyone else to understand the impact of AI on the workplace and show us how to be more productive.

Positive and negative aspects of using ChatGPT in the workplace

The EduBirdie study sheds light on how Generation Z views AI in the workplace, and its findings are both positive and negative. The study surveyed 2,000 Gen Z individuals in the US to determine how they used ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, in their workplace.

On the one hand, it shows that Gen Z is embracing AI technology to aid them in their work tasks. On the other hand, it reveals that many Gen Z individuals are struggling with the guilt and dependency associated with its use.

The study revealed that 36% of Gen Z respondents felt guilty about using AI to aid them in their work tasks. Additionally, 1 in 3 Gen Z respondents expressed concern about relying too heavily on ChatGPT, as they believed it could limit their critical thinking skills. Furthermore, 18% of respondents stated that it hampered their creativity.

One possible explanation for the mixed reactions to AI is that Gen Z individuals are more aware of the potential consequences of its use than previous generations. They have grown up in an era of rapid technological change, and are more likely to be familiar with AI's ethical and social implications. This may explain why they feel a sense of responsibility and guilt when they rely too heavily on AI in their work tasks.

Another factor that could be contributing to the mixed reactions to AI is the lack of education and training. The study also revealed that 20% of Gen Z respondents encountered difficulties while using AI in their workplace, with 2% even being dismissed for using ChatGPT.

This highlights the need for better education and training on the proper and effective use of AI in the workplace.

How Generation Z is using AI

Despite the challenges associated with AI, there are also many benefits. The study shows that almost half of Gen Z respondents agreed that AI made them more creative, and 1 in 7 reported an increase in earnings. This suggests that AI has the potential to enhance productivity and create new opportunities, particularly in fields that require creativity and innovation.

The study showed that 49% of respondents agreed that AI made them more creative, with 1 in 7 reporting an increase in their earnings. Gen Z mainly uses ChatGPT for>

    Researching (61%)
    Generating ideas and brainstorming (56%)
    Writing and generating content (42%)
    Refining their resumes and applications to stand out in the hiring process (23%)

Can ChatGPT replace you?

According to a recent survey, Generation Z is not very concerned about AI replacing them in the workplace this year, with only 9% believing it to be a likely possibility by 2024. However, 61% of respondents think AI could take over their jobs in 10 years. Programmers, in particular, use AI to write code for them, so they are wondering if they could be easily replaced by AI, but it's worth noting that although AI-powered assistants like ChatGPT have a vast amount of domain-specific knowledge to write code, they lack the deep experience and expertise needed to solve very specific or complex problems.

AI is here to stay and has the potential to significantly shape the future of work. As AI continues to evolve, we must strike a balance between using it to our advantage and ensuring that we don't become too reliant on it. With the right education and training, we can harness the power of AI to enhance productivity, creativity, and innovation in the workplace.
