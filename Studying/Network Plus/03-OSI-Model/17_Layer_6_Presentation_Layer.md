Layer 6, the presentation layer.

Now, the presentation layer

is responsible for formatting your data

that's going to be exchanged

and securing the data with proper encryption.

So, when you think about Layer 6,

there's a couple of keywords I want you to remember:

data formatting and encryption.

Every time we talk about data formatting or encryption,

I want you to think about Layer 6,

the presentation layer, inside the OSI model.

Now, when I talk about data formatting, what is that?

Well, data is going to be formatted by a computer

so that it has compatibility between

different types of devices.

There are some common ones out there

that you may or may not have heard of.

The first one is ASCII,

which stands for the American Standard

for Computer Information Interchange.

Now, ASCII is basically text.

It's what says that the capital A is represented

by the number 65.

In the old days of computers, we had ASCII

and it was an 8-bit code

that would tell us exactly what that letter was

or that symbol, and ASCII characters do that for us.

For instance, ASCII character 40

is the @ sign for your email.

Then, we have things like GIFs

which are little pictures that dance around and do motion,

or we have a JPEG file which is used for photographs

or a PNG which is used for images on the Internet.

All of these are different types of data formats

and based on that format, the computer knows

how to represent it on the screen

as it passes those files around.

Because at the end of the day,

all of these file formats really come down

to a series of ones and zeros on your computer's hard drive

or on your network.

Now, when we talk about ASCII,

it really is just a text-based language for us to use.

This is going to ensure that the data is readable

by the receiving system,

because now we're all speaking the exact same language.

Because ASCII isn't the only text-based language out there.

There's Unicode and a series of other ones.

But if we all use ASCII, for instance,

that means we all know

what the proper data structure is for it

and the proper formatting.

This allows us to negotiate data transfer syntax

for our Layer 7 at the application layer,

and we're going to talk about that in the next lesson.

Now, the next piece of this layer,

or Layer 6, is encryption.

This is another thing that the presentation layer

is going to be all about and doing for us.

Encryption is used to scramble data

as it goes in transit to keep it secure

from any prying eyes.

This is going to provide us with confidentiality

of our data as it crosses our network and as it's stored.

Now, some examples of this will be something like TLS

which stands for Transport Layer Security.

And that's what's being used right now

to secure the data between your computer

and a website like Facebook, or Dion Training,

or Amazon, or any of the other ones out there.

If you get that little padlock next to your domain name,

that means you're using a TLS connection.

This creates an encrypted tunnel

so nobody else can see what's inside it

and that way, they can't see your username,

your password, and your credit card information

as you pass it back and forth.

Now, what are some examples of things at Layer 6?

Well, things like scripting languages

are going to be a Layer 6 thing,

because they're formatting data.

So, if we're dealing with HTML, or XML, or PHP, or JavaScript,

all of those tell the text-based ASCII

how it should display differently on the screen.

For example, I want to make this line bold

and make this other one underlined,

and make this size x font.

Those type of things can all be controlled

using a formatting language like HTML

to take the ASCII code that you typed in

and translate it into something that looks better

on the screen.

We also have things like standard text

and this would be things like ASCII, or Unicode, or EBCDIC.

All of these are different ways of displaying text

from those ones and zeros.

We also have things like pictures,

we have GIFs, and JPGs, and TIFs, and SVGs, and PNGs,

and all of these type of files.

They're all different ways of representing ones and zeros

as different graphical formats.

We also have movie files like MP4s, and MPGs,

and MOV files, and all of these are going to show up

as some kind of video for us,

but they're all made up of these ones and zeros

in a particular format and that data formatting

makes it into a movie that you can watch

just like this video right now.

So, all of those examples I showed you so far

are all about presentation,

presenting text, or images, or photographs,

or movies in a different way.

But we also have that example of encryption algorithms.

Things like TLS and SSL.

Now, these are taking your ones and zeros

and presenting them differently, right?

Because they're scrambling them up

so nobody else can see them,

and it secures that data in a jumbled format.

That's the idea here when you start dealing

with TLS and SSL.

So, it is a type of data format,

but it's not just a clear presentation

like we had with a movie file, or a graphic file,

or an audio file, or text.

Instead, when we start dealing with encryption,

we're really focused on the security of the data

by scrambling it up and keeping prying eyes off it.
