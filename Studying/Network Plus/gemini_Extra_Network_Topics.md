## Network Troubleshooting

No network is immune to problems. A structured approach to troubleshooting helps identify and resolve issues efficiently:

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Identify the Problem:** Gather information from users, error messages, and logs. Determine the scope and impact of the issue.
2. **Establish a Theory:** Formulate a hypothesis about the probable cause of the problem.
3. **Test the Theory:** Use tools and techniques to verify your theory and isolate the issue.
4. **Establish a Plan of Action:** Plan the steps to resolve the problem, including potential downtime and impact.
5. **Implement the Solution:** Apply the fix, whether it's a configuration change, hardware replacement, or software update.
6. **Verify Full Functionality:** Ensure that the solution has resolved the problem and hasn't introduced new issues.
7. **Document Findings:** Record the problem, troubleshooting steps, solution, and lessons learned for future reference.

**Tools:**
