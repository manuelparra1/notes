# Phase 1: Network Fundamentals

## Introduction to Networking

This section covers the basics of networking, focusing on two key models that describe how data moves across networks:

- **TCP/IP Network Model**: A four-layer model that includes the Link, Internet, Transport, and Application layers. It's widely used in real-world networking and is more streamlined compared to the OSI model.
- **OSI Reference Model**: A seven-layer model that provides a more detailed framework for understanding network interactions, including the Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application layers.

## IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting/Summarization

- **IPv4 Addressing**: Understanding the 32-bit address format used to identify devices on a network.
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks to improve efficiency and security.
- **Summarization**: Combining multiple smaller networks into a single address to simplify routing.

## Static Routing

- **Static Routing**: Manually configuring the routing table to determine the path data takes through the network. This method is simple and useful for small, stable networks.

## General Switching

This section covers fundamental concepts in switching, which is essential for efficient data flow within local networks:

- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**: Creating logical segmentations within a physical network to improve security and reduce broadcast traffic.
- **Trunk/Access Interfaces**: Understanding the difference between trunk ports, which carry traffic for multiple VLANs, and access ports, which connect to end devices within a single VLAN.

## Layer 2 & 3 Dataflows

- **Layer 2 Dataflow**: Deals with data transfer within the same network segment, using MAC addresses for communication.
- **Layer 3 Dataflow**: Handles data transfer between different network segments or IP subnets, using IP addresses for routing the data.

This phase provides a solid foundation in networking principles, essential for understanding more advanced concepts in subsequent phases.
