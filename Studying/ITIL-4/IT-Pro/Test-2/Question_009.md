E) Guiding Principles

Explanation

Continual improvement, one of five service value system components, consists of reoccurring organizational activities that help meet stakeholders’ expectations. The five service value components work together with an organization's activities as part of the service value system to create the outcome of value creation. The ITIL Service Value System details how an organization's activities and components work together as a single system to create value. As the SVS of each organization interact with other organizations, this can lead to further add value to their stakeholders and customers as well.

The other four service value system components are:

- Governance — A system or framework used to control and manage activities in an organization.
- Guiding principles - These help direct an organization, even through any changes to its management structure, work, goals, or other areas.

- Service value chain — Organizational activities used to implement a service or product to promote value realization.

- Practices — Organizational resources created to reach an objective or conduct work.
