# Test 1

## Question 1:

### Which option(s) is an objective example of customer experience (CX)?

- A) The layout of the service provider's website
- B) None of these options
- C) On-time delivery of what was ordered (Correct)
- D) The friendliness of the customer service representative (My Response)
- E) All of these options

On-time delivery of a product/service is an objective example of customer experience. The success or failure of on-time delivery of a product/service is objectively measurable.

Customer experience can be objective or subjective. Objective aspects of customer experience are objectively measurable, such as the delivery of a product at the promised price and delivery time. Subjective aspects of customer experience depend on the customer's own tastes and expectations, such as the design of the packaging for a product or the “coziness’” of the service provider's store.

The layout of the service provider's website is a subjective example of customer experience, as one customer may like the layout of the website while another customer might dislike it. The friendliness of the customer service representative is also another subjective example of customer experience, as one customer may really like the representative, while another customer may find them rude or unhelpful.

## Question 2:

### Which entity is used to store and protect the authorized versions of all media configuration items (CI's)?

- A) Service Knowledge management System (SKMS)
- B) Configuration Management System (CMS)
- C) Definitive Media Library (DM- L) (Correct)
- D) Configuration Management Database (CMD- B) (My Response)

The Definitive Media Library (DM- L) is used to store and protect authorized versions of media configuration items (Cls). In ITIL version 4, it is important to note that available deployment components should be maintained in one or more secure locations to prevent pre-deployment modifications. The locations for these components are collectively referred to as a definitive media library for documentation and software, as well as a definitive hardware store for hardware components.

The Service Knowledge management System (SKM- S) includes staff experience levels and certifications, performance metrics, partner requirements, and user skill levels. The SKMS contains the Configuration Management System (CMS), the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and other tools, including the Known-Error Database (KEDB). The DML is part of the CMS.

## Question 3:

### Which of the following statements is/are NOT correct about the service desk staff?

1. The service desk should employ high-level technical staff.
2. The service desk provides entry-level positions to people who want to grow into technical or supervisory roles.
3. The service desk staff should be provided adequate training to ensure an effective level of support.

- A) 1 only (Correct)
- B) 1 and 2
- C) All of these (My Response)
- D) 2 only

Explanation
As this is a negatively worded question, the correct answer is that the service desk should employ high-level technical staff. The service desk includes entry-level positions and does not require high-level technical skills to resolve user incidents and service requests.

The Service desk handles incidents and service requests from users. The service desk is commonly the single point of contact for users to report incidents or service requests via phone calls, a Web interface, or automatically reported infrastructure events.

The service desk can be a steppingstone for people who want to grow into technical or supervisory roles. The service desk staff should go through adequate training and gather skills to communicate with different types of users. The Service desk should also have thorough knowledge about the businesses they serve.

## Question 4:

All of these practices interact with value chain activities in varying capacities and intensities.

## Question 6:

### Fill in the blank.

### A \_\_\_ is a series of steps an organization uses to create and deliver products and services to a service consumer.

- A) Value Chain
- B) Process (My Response)
- C) Service
- D) Value Stream (Correct)

Explanation

A value stream is a series of steps an organization uses to create and deliver products and services to a service consumer. A value stream is
a combination of an organization's value chain activities.

A process is a set of activities, which may be interrelated or interacting, that converts inputs into outputs. Processes can improve productivity
and describe the steps to accomplish a goal or objective in a set of procedures. Processes help to define what is involved, who is involved, and
detail instructions on how a process should be implemented.

A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific
costs and risks.

The ITIL service value chain is an operating model for service providers. It covers all the key activities required to effectively manage products
and services.

## Question 7:

### Which Service entity is measurable, performance-driven, and responds to specific triggers?

- A) A Role
- B) A Function (My Response)
- C) A Process (Correct)
- D) A Service

Explanation

A process is measurable, performance-driven, and responds to specific triggers or events.

A function is "a unit of an organization specialized to perform certain types of work and responsible for specific outcomes." Each function has
its own body of knowledge.

A role is "a set of responsibilities, activities, and authorities granted to a person or team." A role is defined by a process.

A service is "a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the ownership of
specific costs and risks."

## Question 8:

### Which of the following service value system components consists of reoccurring organizational activities that help meet stakeholders’ expectations?

- A) Governance
- B) Continual Improvement (Correct)
- C) Service Value Chain (My Response)
- D) Practices
- E) Guiding Principles

Explanation

Continual improvement, one of five service value system components, consists of reoccurring organizational activities that help meet stakeholders’ expectations. The five service value components work together with an organization's activities as part of the service value system to create the outcome of value creation. The ITIL Service Value System details how an organization's activities and components work together as a single system to create value. As the SVS of each organization interact with other organizations, this can lead to further add value to their stakeholders and customers as well.

The other four service value system components are:

- Governance — A system or framework used to control and manage activities in an organization.
- Guiding principles - These help direct an organization, even through any changes to its management structure, work, goals, or other areas.

- Service value chain — Organizational activities used to implement a service or product to promote value realization.

- Practices — Organizational resources created to reach an objective or conduct work.

## Question 9:

### Which of the following statements can be CORRECT regarding the utility of a service?

1. It is the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.
2. It can be summarized as "what the service does."
3. It can be used to determine whether a service is "fit for purpose."
4. It can support the performance of the consumer.
5. It can remove the constraints from the consumer.

- A) 2 and 3
- B) All of these statements are true (Correct)
- C) 1 and 2 (My Response)
- D) 1, 2, and 4

Explanation

All of these statements are correct regarding the utility of a service. Utility is the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Utility is "what the service does." This term is often used to determine whether a service is "tit for purpose." To have utility, a service can support the consumer's performance or remove consumer constraints. Many services do both.

## Question 10:

### Which ITIL management practice is concerned with minimizing the impact of an incident?

- A) Problem Management (My Response)
- B) Monitoring And Event Management
- C) Incident Management (Correct)
- D) Change Enablement/Control

Explanation
The Incident management practice is concerned with minimizing the impact of an incident. Incident management adds value to the business by reducing the impact of service outages. Incident management is responsible for restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible. To manage an incident, you could use the incident model and known error records. Incidents can be reported by anyone who detects a disruptions or potential disruption to normal service. This includes technical staff.

The Monitoring and Event Management practice is concerned with detecting and analyzing events and determining how to manage them.

The Problem management practice is concerned with preventing problems and incidents by eliminating repeat problems or incidents. This practice is also concerned with minimizing the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. A problem is the cause of one or more incidents. There is often a conflict between Problem management and Incident management because Problem management is focusing on identifying permanent solutions and therefore the speed with which these solutions are found is of secondary importance.

The Change enablement/control practice involves ensuring proper risk assessment, change authorizations, and change schedule management to optimize the number of successful product and service changes.

Categorization of incidents is important to establish trends for use in Problem management and other Service management activities. When closing an incident, you should check the incident categorization and correct it if necessary and check that user is satisfied with the outcome.

## Question 11:

### Fill in the blank.

### \_\_\_ enables organizations to assess their offerings against their activities to ensure full value realization.

- A) Environmental Architecture
- B) Service Architecture (My Response)
- C) Technology Architecture
- D) Business Architecture (Correct)
- E) Information Systems Architecture

Explanation

Business architecture enables organizations to assess their offerings against their activities to ensure full value is being realized for the organization and their customer base. A gap analysis can then be generated to current vs. future state needs, followed by the creation of a roadmap to detail the steps that the organization will take in order to achieve their goals of moving from current to future state.

Information systems architecture includes application and data architectures, which detail the physical and logical data assets and data management resources of an organization.

Environmental architecture details the change drivers and external factors of an organization. In addition, environmental architecture describes the types, aspects, and environmental control levels of an organization.

Technology architecture describes the hardware and software infrastructure required for supporting an organizations portfolio of services and products.

Service architecture allows organizations to see all services being provided, including how the service components fit as a whole, along with the interactions, flow of resources and activities of each service.
