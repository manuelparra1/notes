Explanation

Business architecture enables organizations to assess their offerings against their activities to ensure full value is being realized for the organization and their customer base. A gap analysis can then be generated to current vs. future state needs, followed by the creation of a roadmap to detail the steps that the organization will take in order to achieve their goals of moving from current to future state.

Information systems architecture includes application and data architectures, which detail the physical and logical data assets and data management resources of an organization.

Environmental architecture details the change drivers and external factors of an organization. In addition, environmental architecture describes the types, aspects, and environmental control levels of an organization.

Technology architecture describes the hardware and software infrastructure required for supporting an organizations portfolio of services and products.

Service architecture allows organizations to see all services being provided, including how the service components fit as a whole, along with the interactions, flow of resources and activities of each service.
