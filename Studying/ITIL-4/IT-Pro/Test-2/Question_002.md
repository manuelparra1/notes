Which entity is used to store and protect the authorized versions of all media configuration items (CI's)?

A) Service Knowledge management System (SKMS)
B) Configuration Management System (CMS)
C) Definitive Media Library (DML) (Correct)
D) Configuration Management Database (CMDB) (My Response)

The Definitive Media Library (DML) is used to store and protect authorized versions of media configuration items (Cls). In ITIL version 4, it is important to note that available deployment components should be maintained in one or more secure locations to prevent pre-deployment modifications. The locations for these components are collectively referred to as a definitive media library for documentation and software, as well as a definitive hardware store for hardware components.

The Service Knowledge management System (SKMS) includes staff experience levels and certifications, performance metrics, partner requirements, and user skill levels. The SKMS contains the Configuration Management System (CMS), the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and other tools, including the Known-Error Database (KEDB). The DML is part of the CMS.
