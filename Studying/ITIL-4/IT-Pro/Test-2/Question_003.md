A) 1 only (Correct)
B) 1 and 2
C) All of these (My Response)
D) 2 only

Explanation
As this is a negatively worded question, the correct answer is that the service desk should employ high-level technical staff. The service desk includes entry-level positions and does not require high-level technical skills to resolve user incidents and service requests.

The Service desk handles incidents and service requests from users. The service desk is commonly the single point of contact for users to report incidents or service requests via phone calls, a Web interface, or automatically reported infrastructure events.

The service desk can be a steppingstone for people who want to grow into technical or supervisory roles. The service desk staff should go through adequate training and gather skills to communicate with different types of users. The Service desk should also have thorough knowledge about the businesses they serve.
