Which option(s) is an objective example of customer experience (CX)?

A) The layout of the service provider's website
B) None of these options
C) On-time delivery of what was ordered (Correct)
D) The friendliness of the customer service representative (My Response)
E) All of these options

On-time delivery of a product/service is an objective example of customer experience. The success or failure of on-time delivery of a product/service is objectively measurable.

Customer experience can be objective or subjective. Objective aspects of customer experience are objectively measurable, such as the delivery of a product at the promised price and delivery time. Subjective aspects of customer experience depend on the customer's own tastes and expectations, such as the design of the packaging for a product or the “coziness’” of the service provider's store.

The layout of the service provider's website is a subjective example of customer experience, as one customer may like the layout of the website while another customer might dislike it. The friendliness of the customer service representative is also another subjective example of customer experience, as one customer may really like the representative, while another customer may find them rude or unhelpful.
