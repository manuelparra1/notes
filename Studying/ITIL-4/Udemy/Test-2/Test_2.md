## Question 23: Incorrect

#### Your company has recently engaged a new supplier to provide you with 3 routers that will handle 1 Gbps of throughput. They are scheduled for installation in three months. Your team is currently configuring the devices in preparation for installation into the network architecture based upon the design requirements. Which value chain activity would best categorize your configuration actions in this scenario?

- A) Design and transition (Incorrect)
- B) Engage
- C) Obtain/build (Correct)
- D) Deliver and support

**Explanation**
<br>
The ‘obtain/build' value chain activity ensures that service components are available when and where they are needed and meet agreed specifications. Configuration of the devices based upon the designs provided would best be classified as an action that occurs during the 'obtain/build’ value chain activity.

## Question 25: Incorrect

- A) Standard (Incorrect)
- B) Normal (Correct)
- C) Emergency
- D) Routine

**Explanation**
<br>
Normal changes are changes which need to be scheduled, assessed, and authorized following a standard process. These changes are not considered routine (like a standard change). They are also not considered urgent and don't need to be implemented as soon as possible to recover from an incident (like an emergency change). In this example, the system is currently working perfectly fine, but you want to add a new function/feature to improve it. This should go through the normal change process. (Note: Routine is not a type of change in ITIL 4.)

## Question 28: Incorrect

- B) Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of incidents (Incorrect)
- C) Authority to implement changes to a system

**Explanation**
<br>
This process does not usually include detailed procedures on how to diagnose, investigate, and resolve incidents.

## Question 31: Incorrect

#### You are working as a service desk analyst. Within the last hour, you have received 13 calls about users being unable to log on to the network. There appears to be something wrong with the domain controller. What would you classify this scenario as?

- A) Incident (Incorrect)
- B) Workaround
- C) Problem (Correct)
- D) Event

**Explanation**
<br>
A problem is a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents. Since you have received 13 calls (13 potential incidents), and the common issue appears to be the domain controller, the domain controller might be the problem.

## Question 32: Incorrect

#### The users on the fourth floor of your building keep calling the service desk to report that their network connectivity is not working properly. The service desk logs each of these incidents, but since there are multiple incidents for the same issue, they forward it to the problem management activity for resolution. During your analysis, you determine that the network switch that services the entire fourth floor is broken and will need to be replaced. You checked the current inventory of spares, but there are none available. It appears this problem will remain for 24 hours until a new switch can be received and installed, How would you categorize the issue described in this scenario?

- A) Known Error (Correct)
- B) Workaround
- C) Problem
- D) Incident (Incorrect)

**Explanation**
<br>
A known error is a problem that has been analyzed but has not been resolved. Since the issue is known (the network switch is broken and must be replaced), but not resolved (awaiting a new switch to arrive and be configured), this is a known error.

## Question 37: Incorrect

#### You are in a quarterly service level management review with your supervisor. The manager asks your supervisor if the service desk has been meeting their SLA target metrics. Your supervisor proudly proclaims that everything is ‘green’ (meaning, we are meeting all of the targets). Just then, another executive asks, "If everything is showing as ‘green’, why am I hearing other users complain that the service is always unavailable for use?" What might be the reason for this?

- A) Your supervisor's data is based on operational metrics
- B) Your supervisor's data is based on business metrics
- C) Your supervisor's data is based on availability metrics (Incorrect)
- D) Your supervisor's data is not based on business outcomes (Correct)

**Explanation**
<br>
Often, service level management reviews show as a ‘watermelon’, all green on the outside and red on the inside. This means that teams are often measuring the wrong things. For example, if you are measuring the uptime of a single server, this isn't important to the end user or business objective or outcome. Instead, there should be a balanced 'bundle' of metrics to properly account for the business objectives as defined by outcomes and not simply operational metrics.

## Question 38: Incorrect

#### How does 'service level management contribute to the ‘improve' value chain activity?

- A) Uses feedback from users about the service and requirements from customers to make the service better (Correct)
- B) Provides feedback from interactions with customers into new or changed services
- C) Provides information about the actual service performance and trends (Incorrect)
- D) Collects feedback during interactions and communicates service performance objectives to the operations and support teams

**Explanation**
<br>
The 'improve' activity in the service level management practice uses feedback from users about the service and requirements from customers to make recommendations to improve the service.

## Question 40: Incorrect

- A) Ensuring users continue to be productive when they need assistance from the service provider
- B) Collecti user-specific requirements, setting expectations, and providing status updates (Incorrect)
- C) Acquiring pre-approved service components to help fulfill service requests
- D) Initiating standard changes to fulfill service requests (Correct)

**Explanation**
<br>
This is the ‘design and transition’ activity. Standard changes to services can be initiated and fulfilled as service requests.
