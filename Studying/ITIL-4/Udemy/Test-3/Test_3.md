### Your laptop only has a 256GB of SSD storage installed. You have been traveling for work for the last 2 weeks and have downloaded a lot of video files to your internal storage device. Your computer is having issues because there is not enough free space. You called your service desk, but since you are out of the country, they cannot remotely back up all the files on your laptop. They recommend that you move the large files from your internal storage device (256GB SSD) to an external hard drive to free up some available space. Unfortunately, you don't have an external hard drive with you, so you will purchase one at the store later today. How would you classify this situation and the solution recommended?
