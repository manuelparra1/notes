- A) Developing features **(Correct)**
- B) Planning changes
- C) Avoiding conflicts
- D) Assigning resources **(Incorrect)**

**Explanation**

- A) Developing Features (Correct):

> A change schedule is not typically used for developing features but rather for planning and scheduling changes. Developing features is a separate process that involves designing, coding, testing, and deploying new functionality or enhancements to a system or application. While changes may be required to implement new features, the development of those features themselves is not the primary purpose of a change schedule.

- B) Planning Changes:

> This is a primary purpose of a change schedule.

- C) Avoiding Conflicts:

> This statement underscores another important purpose of a change schedule, which is to avoid conflicts between different changes that may impact the same systems or resources. By maintaining a centralized change schedule, organizations can identify potential conflicts or overlaps in proposed changes and take proactive measures to mitigate risks. This helps ensure that changes are implemented smoothly and do not inadvertently cause disruptions or conflicts with other activities or services.

- D) Assigning resources (Incorrect):

> Assigning resources can be part of the change scheduling process.

**Explanation**

- B) Provides information about the actual service performance and trends (Correct):

> Service level management contributes to the 'plan' value chain activity by providing information about service performance and trends, which helps in planning improvements.

- A) Uses feedback from users about the service and requirements from customers to make the service better:

> While feedback is important, it is not specifically about service performance and trends.

- C) Collects and processes feedback from customers and users:

> Similar to option A, this is about feedback rather than service performance and trends.

- D) Collects feedback during interactions and communicates service performance objectives to the operations and support teams (Incorrect):

> This is more about communication within the organization rather than providing information for planning improvements.

# Test 2

## Question 2: Incorrect

### Identify the missing word(s) in the following sentence. A customer is a person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the [?] of service consumption.

- A) Outcomes **(Correct)**
- B) Cost **(Incorrect)**
- C) Outputs
- D) Benefits

**Explanation**

- A) Outcomes (Correct):

> This option fits logically in the sentence. In service management, customers define their requirements with the expectation of achieving certain outcomes or results from the service. Therefore, "outcomes" is the appropriate word to complete the sentence.

- B) Cost (Incorrect):

> While cost can be a consideration for customers, it does not accurately complete the sentence in the context provided. The sentence is focusing on defining requirements and taking responsibility for the consumption of the service, which is more closely related to outcomes rather than cost.

- C) Outputs:

> This option does not accurately complete the sentence. Outputs typically refer to the tangible results produced by a process or service, but it does not align with the context of defining requirements and taking responsibility for service consumption.

- D) Benefits:

> While benefits are indeed an important aspect of services, they do not accurately complete the sentence in this context. The sentence is describing the role of a customer in defining service requirements and taking responsibility for service consumption, which is more closely related to outcomes.

## Question 3: Incorrect

**What is the definition of an IT asset?**

- A) A particular set of settings or options on a given piece of equipment
- B) Any valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT product or service **(Correct)**
- C) A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks
- D) Any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service **(Incorrect)**

**Explanation**

- A) A particular set of settings or options on a given piece of equipment:

> This option describes a configuration or setting of a piece of equipment rather than the concept of an IT asset. It focuses on the settings or options of the equipment rather than the equipment itself. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- B) Any valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT product or service (Correct):

> This option accurately defines an IT asset. An IT asset refers to any valuable component, tangible or intangible, that contributes to the delivery of an IT product or service. This definition encompasses a wide range of items, including hardware, software, data, facilities, and personnel, among others. Therefore, this option is correct.

- C) A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks:

> This option describes the concept of a service rather than an IT asset. It focuses on the value co-creation process and outcomes desired by customers, which is related to services rather than assets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- D) Any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service (Incorrect):

> While IT assets do need to be managed to support the delivery of IT services, this definition is too narrow and does not encompass the full scope of what constitutes an IT asset. IT assets can include components beyond those directly involved in service delivery, such as infrastructure, software licenses, intellectual property, and more. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

## Question 17: Incorrect

**During a review of the New Account Creation process at your company, you determine that the current process requires 15 steps to create a new account. As you analyze each step, you find that steps 3 and 5 provide no value to the process or the organization. Based on which guiding principle should you eliminate steps 3 and 5 from the process?**

- A) Think and work holistically
- B) Keep it simple and practical **(Correct)**
- C) Optimize and automate **(Incorrect)**
- D) Focus on value

**Explanation**

- A) Think and work holistically:

> This guiding principle emphasizes considering the entire system or process as a whole and understanding how individual components interact. While holistic thinking is important for process improvement, it does not specifically address the need to eliminate unnecessary steps that do not add value. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- B) Keep it simple and practical (Correct):

> This guiding principle emphasizes simplifying processes and avoiding unnecessary complexity to make them more efficient and effective. By eliminating steps 3 and 5, which provide no value to the process or organization, you are adhering to the principle of keeping the process simple and practical. Therefore, this option is correct.

- C) Optimize and automate:

> This guiding principle focuses on optimizing processes for efficiency and effectiveness and automating repetitive tasks where possible. While optimization is important, it does not specifically address the elimination of steps that do not add value. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- D) Focus on value:

> This guiding principle emphasizes delivering value to customers and stakeholders and prioritizing activities that contribute to that value. Eliminating steps 3 and 5, which provide no value to the process or organization, aligns with this principle. However, the more specific guiding principle for this scenario is "Keep it simple and practical." Therefore, while focusing on value is important, it is not the most relevant guiding principle in this context. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

## Question 23: Incorrect

**Your company has recently engaged a new supplier to provide you with 3 routers that will handle 1 Gbps of throughput. They are scheduled for installation in three months. Your team is currently configuring the devices in preparation for installation into the network architecture based upon the design requirements. Which value chain activity would best categorize your configuration actions in this scenario?**

- A) Design and transition **(Incorrect)**
- B) Engage
- C) Obtain/build **(Correct)**
- D) Deliver and support

**Explanation**

- A) Design and transition (Incorrect):

> The design and transition value chain activity involves designing new or changed services and preparing them for deployment into the production environment. While configuration of devices is part of the transition phase, in this scenario, the routers have already been procured, and the team is configuring them for installation. Therefore, this option is not the best fit.

- B) Engage:

> The engage value chain activity focuses on engaging with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and requirements. While engagement with suppliers may be involved in the procurement process, the scenario describes the team's actions in configuring the routers, which is more operational in nature. Therefore, this option is not the best fit.

- C) Obtain/build (Correct):

> The obtain/build value chain activity involves obtaining or building the necessary service components to fulfill service requests. In this scenario, the team is configuring the routers in preparation for installation into the network architecture. This aligns with the concept of obtaining/building service components, as the routers are being configured to meet the design requirements. Therefore, this option is the best fit.

- D) Deliver and support:

> The deliver and support value chain activity focuses on delivering services to customers and providing ongoing support. While configuration of devices may be part of service delivery, in this scenario, the focus is on preparing the routers for installation, rather than delivering services to customers. Therefore, this option is not the best fit.

## Question 25: Incorrect

**You are working as part of an improvement initiative and your team would like to release a new module into the existing Customer Relationship Management system. Which type of change should you initiate?**

- A) Standard **(Incorrect)**
- B) Normal **(Correct)**
- C) Emergency
- D) Routine

**Explanation**

- A) Standard (Incorrect):

> Standard changes are pre-authorized and routine changes that follow established procedures without the need for additional approval. These changes are low-risk and have been fully assessed and documented. However, introducing a new module into an existing system typically requires more scrutiny and planning than a standard change, as it may involve significant alterations to the system's functionality. Therefore, standard change is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario.

- B) Normal (Correct):

> Normal changes are changes that are not categorized as standard, emergency, or routine. They require assessment, authorization, and implementation planning based on the potential impact and risk associated with the change. Introducing a new module into an existing system falls under the category of a normal change because it involves modifying the system's configuration and functionality, which may impact users and business operations. Therefore, initiating a normal change is the correct choice for this scenario.

- C) Emergency:

> Emergency changes are changes that must be implemented immediately to resolve critical issues that pose a significant risk to the business or its customers. Releasing a new module into a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is unlikely to qualify as an emergency change unless there is an urgent need to address a critical business issue. Therefore, emergency change is not the most suitable option in this scenario.

- D) Routine:

> Routine changes are repetitive and have low risk, typically following standard procedures and requiring minimal authorization. However, introducing a new module into an existing CRM system is a significant change that would not be considered routine. Therefore, routine change is not the appropriate choice in this scenario.

## Question 28: Incorrect

**You are attempting to print a document from your workstation to the network printer in your office. The print job failed when you attempted to print, so you called the service desk for assistance. What term best describes your issue?**

- A) Problem
- B) Event **(Incorrect)**
- C) Incident **(Correct)**
- D) Resolution

**Explanation**

- A) Problem:

> A problem is an underlying cause of one or more incidents. It is typically identified through the analysis of multiple related incidents and involves investigating the root cause to prevent recurrence. However, in this scenario, you are experiencing a specific issue with printing a document, which is better classified as an incident rather than a problem.

- B) Event (Incorrect):

> An event is simply a change of state that has significance for the management of an IT service or other configuration item. It could be an occurrence or a notification that could lead to an incident or a problem. However, the act of attempting to print and encountering a failure is more appropriately categorized as an incident, which directly impacts service delivery.

- C) Incident (Correct):

> An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. In this scenario, your inability to print the document due to a failed print job aligns with the definition of an incident. You have experienced a disruption to the normal functioning of the service, prompting you to seek assistance from the service desk.

- D) Resolution:

> Resolution refers to the successful handling and closure of an incident, problem, or service request. While resolution is the ultimate goal of incident management, it does not describe the issue itself. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate term for the described scenario.

## Question 30: Incorrect

**What is usually included as part of ‘incident management’?**

- A) Scripts for collecting initial information about incidents **(Correct)**
- B) Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of incidents **(Incorrect)**
- C) Authority to implement changes to a system
- D) Observation of all services and service components to identify any change in state

**Explanation**

- A) Scripts for collecting initial information about incidents (Correct):

> This option is correct. Incident management often involves predefined scripts or templates for collecting initial information about incidents when they are reported. These scripts help ensure that relevant details are captured consistently and efficiently, facilitating the initial assessment and prioritization of incidents.

- B) Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of incidents (Incorrect):

> While incident management may involve some level of diagnosis to determine the root cause of incidents, detailed diagnostic procedures are typically part of problem management rather than incident management. Incident management primarily focuses on restoring normal service operations as quickly as possible, whereas problem management involves investigating the underlying causes of incidents to prevent recurrence.

- C) Authority to implement changes to a system:

> Incident management is primarily concerned with restoring normal service operations and minimizing the impact of incidents. While incident responders may identify opportunities for improvements or changes during incident resolution, the authority to implement changes typically lies with change management rather than incident management.

- D) Observation of all services and service components to identify any change in state:

> While monitoring and observation of services and components are essential for detecting incidents and changes in state, this responsibility falls under the domain of event management rather than incident management. Event management involves monitoring and analyzing events to identify significant changes or potential issues that may require further investigation or action.

## Question 31: Incorrect

**You are working as a service desk analyst. Within the last hour, you have received 13 calls about users being unable to log on to the network. There appears to be something wrong with the domain controller. What would you classify this scenario as?**

- A) Incident **(Incorrect)**
- B) Workaround
- C) Problem **(Correct)**
- D) Event

**Explanation**

- A) Incident (Incorrect):

> An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. In this scenario, users being unable to log on to the network due to an issue with the domain controller constitutes an incident. However, the scenario describes multiple occurrences of the same issue affecting multiple users, indicating a potential underlying problem rather than a single isolated incident.

- B) Workaround:

> A workaround is a temporary solution or bypass that mitigates the impact of an incident or problem until a permanent solution can be implemented. While service desk analysts may implement workarounds to restore service quickly, the scenario does not explicitly mention any temporary solutions being applied.

- C) Problem (Correct):

> A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. In this scenario, the recurring issue of users being unable to log on to the network due to a problem with the domain controller suggests an underlying issue with the domain controller itself. Therefore, classifying this scenario as a problem is appropriate, as it requires investigation to identify and address the root cause to prevent further incidents.

- D) Event:

> An event is simply a change of state that has significance for the management of an IT service or other configuration item. While the scenario involves an issue with the domain controller, which could be triggered by an event such as a failure or error, the term "event" does not accurately capture the ongoing impact on service availability experienced by users.

## Question 32: Incorrect

**The users on the fourth floor of your building keep calling the service desk to report that their network connectivity is not working properly. The service desk logs each of these incidents, but since there are multiple incidents for the same issue, they forward it to the problem management activity for resolution. During your analysis, you determine that the network switch that services the entire fourth floor is broken and will need to be replaced. You checked the current inventory of spares, but there are none available. It appears this problem will remain for 24 hours until a new switch can be received and installed, How would you categorize the issue described in this scenario?**

- A) Known Error **(Correct)**
- B) Workaround
- C) Problem
- D) Incident **(Incorrect)**

**Explanation**

- A) Known Error (Correct):

> A known error is a problem that has a documented root cause and a workaround or resolution. In this scenario, the issue with the network switch on the fourth floor has been identified as the root cause of multiple incidents of network connectivity issues. Since the cause of the problem is known and documented (the broken network switch), and there is no immediate resolution available due to the lack of spare switches, it fits the definition of a known error.

- B) Workaround:

> A workaround is a temporary solution or bypass that mitigates the impact of an incident or problem until a permanent solution can be implemented. While workarounds may be applied in situations where a resolution is not immediately available, the scenario does not mention any specific temporary measures being implemented to address the network connectivity issue.

- C) Problem:

> A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. In this scenario, the underlying cause of the incidents (network connectivity issues) is identified as a broken network switch. Therefore, it could be considered a problem. However, since the cause of the problem is already known and documented, it more accurately fits the definition of a known error.

- D) Incident (Incorrect):

> An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. While the incidents reported by users on the fourth floor are symptoms of the underlying problem with the network switch, the focus of this question is on categorizing the root cause rather than the individual incidents.

## Question 37: Incorrect

**You are in a quarterly service level management review with your supervisor. The manager asks your supervisor if the service desk has been meeting their SLA target metrics. Your supervisor proudly proclaims that everything is ‘green’ (meaning, we are meeting all of the targets). Just then, another executive asks, "If everything is showing as ‘green’, why am I hearing other users complain that the service is always unavailable for use?" What might be the reason for this?**

- A) Your supervisor's data is based on operational metrics
- B) Your supervisor's data is based on business metrics
- C) Your supervisor's data is based on availability metrics **(Incorrect)**
- D) Your supervisor's data is not based on business outcomes **(Correct)**

**Explanation**

- D) Your supervisor's data is not based on business outcomes (Correct):

> This option correctly identifies a potential reason why users may complain despite service metrics showing green. It suggests that the metrics used by the supervisor may not accurately reflect the actual impact on business outcomes.

- A) Your supervisor's data is based on operational metrics:

> This option suggests that the supervisor's data may focus solely on operational aspects rather than broader business outcomes.

- B) Your supervisor's data is based on business metrics:

> This option contradicts the scenario, as it implies that the metrics used should reflect business outcomes.

- C) Your supervisor's data is based on availability metrics (Incorrect):

> While availability metrics may be part of the overall service metrics, focusing solely on them does not explain the discrepancy between metrics and user complaints.
