Can you make sure to include each incorrect choice for each question and explain what it corresponds to in ITIL 4 and it doesn't that indicate that?

Sure, I'd be happy to explain what each incorrect choice for each question corresponds to in ITIL 4 and what it does not indicate.

Test 1:

Question 14:

    A) Progress iteratively with feedback: This guiding principle is about breaking down work into smaller, manageable pieces and incorporating feedback throughout the process. While it is important for delivering value, it is not the guiding principle most affected by customer experience.

Question 20:

    A) Work-flow management and inventory systems: These are not a key focus of the 'partners and suppliers' dimension. Instead, this dimension focuses on the roles and responsibilities, contracts and agreements, and security and compliance of partners and suppliers.

Question 24:

    A) Where are we now: This step of the continual improvement model involves assessing the current state of the organization. It is not the step that states that "each improvement initiative should support the organization's goals and objectives."

Question 29:

    A) Developing features: A change schedule is not used for developing features. It is used for planning and coordinating changes to the IT infrastructure.

Question 32:

    A) Problem Identification: Problem identification is not a phase in problem management. Instead, problem management consists of the phases of problem classification, problem control, and error control.

Question 39:

    A) Uses feedback from users about the service and requirements from customers to make the service better: This is not how service level management contributes to the 'plan' value chain activity. Instead, service level management contributes to the 'plan' value chain activity by providing information about the actual service performance and trends.

Test 2:

Question 2:

    A) Products: A customer is a person who uses services, not products.

Question 3:

    B) An unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service: This is the definition of an incident, not a change.
    C) A cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents: This is the definition of a problem, not a change.
    D) An issue that has been analyzed but has not been resolved: This is the definition of a known error, not a change.

Question 4:

    A) Service Offering: This term does not describe the activities performed by Dion Training in this example. Instead, the activities performed by Dion Training are described as service consumption.

Question 5:

    A) Warranty: This term does not describe a service that is 'fit for purpose'. Instead, a service that is 'fit for purpose' is able to deliver the outcomes that the customer wants to achieve.

Question 6:

    A) Deliver And Support: This value chain activity does not ensure that service components are available when and where they are needed and meet agreed specifications. Instead, this value chain activity is responsible for ensuring that products and services are delivered and supported according to agreed-upon requirements.

Question 7:

    A) Standard: A standard change is a pre-approved change that follows a standard change process. It is not the type of change that should be initiated for installing a server on the corporate network.

    B) Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of incidents: These procedures are not usually included as part of incident management. Instead, incident management includes formalized processes for logging incidents.

Question 9:

    A) By collecting user-specific request requirements: This is not how service request management contributes to ‘design and transition’ activity. Instead, service request management contributes to ‘design and transition’ activity by acquiring pre-approved service components to help fulfill service requests.

Question 11:

    B) Initiate and fulfill standard changes: This is not an example of an action a service request management employee would undertake as part of the ‘engage’ activity. Instead, an example of an action a service request management employee would undertake as part of the ‘engage’ activity is communicating with consumers to understand their requirements.

Test 3:

Question 4:

Question 31:

    B) How do we get there: This step of the continual improvement model involves developing a plan to achieve the vision and goals. It is not the step that comes after ‘how do we keep the momentum going’.

Instead, this value chain activity is responsible for ensuring that products and services are delivered and supported according to agreed-upon requirements.

Question 28:

    B) Event: An event is a change in the status of a configuration item or an incident that is not caused by a user. It is not a term that describes an issue that can be resolved by moving large files to an external hard drive.
