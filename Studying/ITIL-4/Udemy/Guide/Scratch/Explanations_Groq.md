Study Guide and Clarification:

1. Guiding Principle and Customer Experience (CX): The guiding principle most affected by CX is "Focus on value." This is because the customer experience is an essential element of value, and it must be actively managed. The organization should understand how service consumers use each service and the entirety of the interactions that a customer has with the organization and its products to fully understand the customer experience.

2. Partners and Suppliers: The 'partners and suppliers' dimension focuses on the organization's relationships with other organizations involved in the design, development, deployment, delivery, support, and/or continual improvement of services. This includes contracts and other agreements between the organization and its partners or suppliers. The option "Work-flow management and inventory systems" is not a key focus of this dimension.

3. Continual Improvement Model: The step that states "each improvement initiative should support the organization's goals and objectives" is called 'what is the vision'. This is a critical step in the continual improvement model, as it ensures that all improvement initiatives align with the organization's strategic objectives.

4. Change Schedule: A change schedule is used to plan changes, assist in communication, avoid conflicts, and assign resources. It is not used to develop features for a service.

5. Problem Management: Problem management involves three distinct phases: problem identification, problem control, and error control. The phase "problem classification" is correct, while "problem control" and "error control" are the other two phases.

6. Service Level Management: Service level management contributes to the 'plan' value chain activity by providing information about the actual service performance and trends. This information supports planning of the product and service portfolio and service offerings.

7. Customer and Service: A customer is a person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.

8. IT Asset: An IT asset is any valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT product or service.

9. Guiding Principle and Process Improvement: The guiding principle "Keep it simple and practical" should be used when analyzing a practice, process, service, metric, or other improvement targets. If a step or element does not contribute to value creation, it should be eliminated to simplify the process.

10. Obtain/Build Value Chain Activity: The 'obtain/build' value chain activity ensures that service components are available when and where they are needed and meet agreed specifications. Configuring devices based upon the designs provided would best be classified as an action that occurs during the 'obtain/build' value chain activity.

11. Change Type: A normal change is a change that needs to be scheduled, assessed, and authorized following a standard process. These changes are not considered routine or urgent and don't need to be implemented as soon as possible to recover from an incident.

12. Incident, Problem, or Known Error: An incident is an unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service. A problem is a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents. A known error is a problem that has been analyzed but has not been resolved.

13. Service Level Management and Improve Value Chain Activity: Service level management contributes to the 'improve' value chain activity by using feedback from users about the service and requirements from customers to make the service better.
