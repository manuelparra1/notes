The correct answer is A) Scripts for collecting initial information about incidents. These scripts or procedures help to gather consistent and complete information when an incident is reported, which is crucial for effective incident management.

B) Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of incidents is not typically included as part of incident management. Instead, this would be more aligned with problem management, which aims to identify and address the root cause of incidents.

C) Authority to implement changes to a system is not typically included as part of incident management either. Instead, this would be more aligned with change management, which aims to ensure that all changes to the IT infrastructure are made in a controlled and coordinated manner.

D) Observation of all services and service components to identify any change in state is also not typically included as part of incident management. Instead, this would be more aligned with event management, which aims to detect and report events, and to manage them before they become incidents.
