1. Understanding the concept of utility (fitness for purpose):
Utility refers to the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need or achieve a specific outcome. It is about the service being "fit for purpose" and providing the intended value to the customer. A service with high utility is one that is suitable for its intended use and satisfies the customer's requirements.

Common confused term: Warranty
Warranty refers to the assurance that a product or service will meet specified performance and quality levels. It is a guarantee or promise from the provider, whereas utility is about the functionality and fitness for purpose.
