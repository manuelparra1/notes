## Difference

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and LOGSYS are both security solutions, but they have different focuses. SIEM is a comprehensive security management system that collects and analyzes security event logs from various sources to identify potential security threats. On the other hand, LOGSYS is primarily focused on log collection and analysis for compliance purposes. In short, SIEM offers more extensive security features, while LOGSYS is more focused on logging and compliance.
