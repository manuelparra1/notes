      "content": "The depreciation of an iPad Pro in a year can vary based on several factors, including the model, storage capacity, condition, and market demand for used iPads. Generally, Apple products like the iPad Pro retain their value better than many other electronics due to the brand's strong resale value and long update cycles. On average, an iPad Pro might depreciate about 20% to 40% in the first year, depending on how well it's maintained and market conditions."

      "content": "The 6th generation iPad Pro 12.9-inch with 1TB of storage and cellular connectivity had an original retail price of approximately $1,899 in the United States. This price may vary slightly based on specific configurations and the inclusion of accessories or additional services.

      "content": "I just bought the latest one that came out May 15 2024. I bought it through Verizon and it’s with a 36 month contract which they will give me 280 dollars off divided into each payment. They also gave me a discount for the service line from $20 to 8.50 after a 50 percent discount and 15 percent off military discount. With my new job I might pay it off early and ignore losing out on the future savings of 7.77 per month. It wouldn’t be worth it right? To keep paying? If I could sell it for $1680 (I paid 2099 before the $280 discount divided into installment plan) and use the money towards buying a new one. Or is it a good deal with the line discount? Typically iPads are useful 4 years. Most people still use the 2018 model."

      "content": "Congratulations on your new iPad Pro!\n\nFirst, let's break down your deal:\n\n1. You got a $280 discount on the iPad Pro, which is a good deal.\n2. You're paying $2099 - $280 = $1819 for the iPad Pro.\n3. You're on a 36-month contract, which means you'll be paying approximately $50.52 per month ($1819 ÷ 36 months).\n4. You're getting a discounted service line for $8.50 per month, which is a great deal.\n\nNow, considering your situation:\n\n1. You might pay off the iPad Pro early, which could save you around $7.77 per month for the remaining months.\n2. If you sell the iPad Pro for $1680, you'll be losing out on the future savings of $7.77 per month.\n3. You're considering using the money from selling the iPad Pro to buy a new one.\n\nPros of paying off the contract early:\n\n* You'll stop paying the monthly installments, which will save you money in the long run.\n* You won't be tied to the 36-month contract.\n\nCons of paying off the contract early:\n\n* You'll lose the discounted service line, which is a good deal.\n* You'll need to consider the opportunity cost of using the money for a new iPad Pro instead of keeping the current one.\n\nPros of keeping the current iPad Pro and contract:\n\n* You'll keep the discounted service line, which is a good deal.\n* You'll have a reliable and high-end iPad Pro for the next few years.\n\nCons of keeping the current iPad Pro and contract:\n\n* You'll continue paying the monthly installments.\n* You might miss out on newer iPad Pro models or features.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your priorities and needs. If you value having the latest and greatest iPad Pro models, selling your current one and upgrading might be the better option. However, if you're happy with your current iPad Pro and the discounted service line is important to you, it might be worth continuing with the contract.\n\nKeep in mind that iPads are known for their durability and longevity, so even if you keep your current iPad Pro for 4 years, it will likely still be a capable device."

It would be useful to have a 2nd screen to read notes and research off of. I will then need access to internet on my laptop when living in the provided hotels. I have 25 gb of hotspot on my phone and the ipad will add another 25, not to mention the unlimited data on the device itself."

      "content": "With your new 100% travel job and 5-month training coming up, having a reliable device like the iPad Pro with cellular connectivity will be extremely useful. The additional 25GB of hotspot data will definitely come in handy, especially when you'll be living in hotels and need a stable internet connection.\n\nHaving a second screen to read notes and research will greatly enhance your productivity and learning experience during this intense training period. The iPad Pro's portability and versatility will allow you to work efficiently in different environments, whether it's in a hotel room, a study area, or even during downtime between training sessions.\n\nConsidering your new job requirements and the benefits of the iPad Pro, it might be worth keeping the device and contract, especially since you've already got a good deal on the service line. The discounted service line will provide you with a reliable and affordable way to stay connected on the go.\n\nAdditionally, having a dedicated device for work and study will help you maintain a better work-life balance, which is essential for your mental and physical well-being during this demanding period.\n\nIn this context, it might be more beneficial to focus on making the most of your iPad Pro and service plan, rather than selling it and potentially disrupting your workflow."
