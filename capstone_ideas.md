Emphasize Machine Learning skills
to future employers, specifically Spotify.
Show data science pipeline proficiency.

### Goal

Predict Chart Topping Music based on
acoustic features.

### Pitch

Hello, my name is Manuel, and I'm a data scientist.

Today, I'd like to share with you a potential project to work
on that could help the music industry or at least
make your portfolio look great to future employers.

As you all may know, the Billboard Hot 100 chart has been a
barometer of the most popular music in America for the past 65 years.
However, predicting which songs will become chart-toppers
has always been a challenge, just as predicting any type of hit or virality is.
Not many people would argue that we are right in the middle of a 90's
Dotcom Boom equivalent for AI and Machine Learning, which was
highlighted this year by ChatGPT.

We now have the opportunity to use data science
to help solve this problem.

For this project, we could be using data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart
and the Spotify API to build a predictive model that can identify
which new songs are most likely to become chart-toppers,
based on their audio features.

For this project, we'll gather audio analysis features for
thousands of songs using the Spotify API, including energy,
danceability, key, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, and
tempo. We'll also use the weekly chart data for the Billboard Hot 100,
which is available for free on their website or a pre-scraped
dataset on Github.

Using machine learning algorithms, we'll build a predictive model
that can accurately predict the chart success of new songs based
on their audio features. This will provide valuable insights into
the most important audio features that drive chart success, which
could inform music production and marketing strategies.

We'll also provide recommendations for optimizing the release timing
and marketing strategy of new songs based on their predicted chart
success. By using data-driven insights, we can improve the success
rate of new songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which could result
in increased revenue and profitability for record labels and artists.

Overall, this project could provide valuable insights and
recommendations for stakeholders in the music industry
to improve the success rate of new songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Thank you for your attention, and please let me know if you have any questions.
